Research Question: Does the number of hours worked per week (<em>workweek</em>) predict family income (<em>income</em>)?




Using Polit2SetA data set, run a simple regression using Family Income (<em>income</em>) as the outcome variable (Y) and Number of Hours Worked per Week (<em>workweek</em>) as the independent variable (X). When conducting any regression analysis, the dependent (outcome) variables is always (Y) and is placed on the y-axis, and the independent (predictor) variable is always (X) and is placed on the x-axis.




Follow these steps when using SPSS:

<ol>

 <li>Open Polit2SetA data set.</li>

 <li>Click on <strong>Analyze</strong>, then click on <strong>Regression</strong>, then <strong>Linear</strong>.</li>

 <li>Move the dependent variable (<em>income</em>) in the box labeled “Dependent” by clicking the arrow button. The dependent variable is a continuous variable.</li>

 <li>Move the independent variable (<em>workweek</em>) into the box labeled “Independent.”</li>

 <li>Click on the <strong>Statistics </strong>button (right side of box) and click on <strong>Descriptives</strong>, <strong>Estimates</strong>, <strong>Confidence Interval</strong> (should be 95%), and <strong>Model Fit</strong>, then click on <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>

 <li>Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<strong><u>Assignment:</u></strong> Through analysis of the SPSS output, answer the following questions.

<ol>

 <li>What is the total sample size?</li>

 <li>What is the mean income and mean number of hours worked?</li>

 <li>What is the correlation coefficient between the outcome and predictor variables? Is it significant? How would you describe the strength and direction of the relationship?</li>

 <li>What it the value of R squared (coefficient of determination)? Interpret the value.</li>

 <li>Interpret the standard error of the estimate? What information does this value provide to the researcher?</li>

 <li>The model fit is determined by the ANOVA table results (<em>F</em> statistic = 37.226, 1,376 degrees of freedom, and the <em>p</em> value is .001). Based on these results, does the model fit the data? Briefly explain. (Hint: A significant finding indicates good model fit.)</li>

 <li>Based on the coefficients, what is the value of the y-intercept (point at which the line of best fit crosses the y-axis)?</li>

 <li>Based on the output, write out the regression equation for predicting family income.</li>

 <li>Using the regression equation, what is the predicted monthly family income for women working 35 hours per week?</li>

 <li>Using the regression equation, what is the predicted monthly family income for women working 20 hours per week?</li>

</ol>




<strong><u>Multiple Regression</u></strong>

<strong><u>Assignment:</u></strong> In this assignment we are trying to predict CES-D score (depression) in women. The research question is: How well do age, educational attainment, employment, abuse, and poor health predict depression?




Using Polit2SetC data set, run a multiple regression using CES-D Score (<em>cesd</em>) as the outcome variable (Y) and respondent’s age (<em>age</em>), educational attainment (<em>educatn</em>), currently employed (<em>worknow</em>), number, types of abuse (<em>nabuse</em>), and poor health (<em>poorhlth</em>) as the independent variables (X). When conducting any regression analysis, the dependent (outcome) variables is always (Y) and is placed on the y-axis, and the independent (predictor) variable is always (X) and is placed on the x-axis.




Follow these steps when using SPSS:

<ol>

 <li>Open Polit2SetC data set.</li>

 <li>Click on <strong>Analyze, </strong>then click on <strong>Regression</strong>, then <strong>Linear</strong>.</li>

 <li>Move the dependent variable, CES-D Score (<em>cesd</em>) into the box labeled “Dependent” by clicking on the arrow button. The dependent variable is a continuous variable.</li>

 <li>Move the independent variables (<em>age</em>, <em>educatn</em>, <em>worknow</em>, and <em>poorhlth</em>) into the box labeled “Independent.” This is the first block of variables to be entered into the analysis (block 1 of 1). Click on the bottom (top right of independent box), marked “Next”; this will give you another box to enter the next block of indepdent variables (block 2 of 2). Here you are to enter (<em>nabuse</em>). <strong>Note:</strong> Be sure the Method box states “Enter”.</li>

 <li>Click on the <strong>Statistics</strong> button (right side of box) and click on <strong>Descriptives</strong>, <strong>Estimates</strong>, <strong>Confidence Interval</strong> (should be 95%), <strong>R square change</strong>, and <strong>Model Fit</strong>, and then click on <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>

 <li>Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<strong><u>Assignment:</u></strong> (When answering all questions, use the data on the coefficients panel from Model 2).

<ol>

 <li>Analyze the data from the SPSS output and write a paragraph summarizing the findings. (Use the example in the SPSS output file as a guide for your write-up.)</li>

 <li>Which of the predictors were significant predictors in the model?</li>

 <li>Which of the predictors was the most relevant predictor in the model?</li>

 <li>Interpret the unstandardized coefficents for educational attainment and poor health.</li>

 <li>If you wanted to predict a woman’s current CES-D score based on the analysis, what would the unstandardized regression equation be? Include unstandardized coefficients in the equation.</li>
